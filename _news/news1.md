A method based on compressive sensing (CS) is proposed for reducing the acquisition time and noise of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). It is aimed at making up for the disadvantages of OCTA including motion-induced artifact and noise. The results show that vasculature structures can be reconstructed well through CS on B-scans with a sampling rate of 70%. Moreover, the noise can be significantly eliminated by CGM filter.
