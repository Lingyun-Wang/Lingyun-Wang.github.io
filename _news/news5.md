The high resolution of optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows for imaging micro-structure features in tissues. Broad-band light source is typically used to improve the axial resolution of OCT but leads to an increased cost. Many real-valued networks were employed to achieve OCT super-resolution. However, they ignore the phase which contains structural information. Therefore, we proposed a complex-valued enhanced deep super-resolution network (Cv-EDSR) based on EDSR to achieve axial super-resolution. The Cv-EDSR and EDSR were evaluated on two datasets. The results show that the SR images generated by the Cv-EDSR have more realistic structures and better image metrics.
