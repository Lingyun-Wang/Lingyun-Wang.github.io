 In this study, we propose to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to monitor ADS in vivo through three‐dimensional imaging. A swept source OCT system with 
 a handheld probe was developed for in vivo skin imaging. Moreover, a cell in‐growth, vascular regeneration, and scaffold degradation rate (IRDR) was defined 
 with the volume reduction rate of the scaffold's collagen sponge layer. To measure the IRDR, a semiautomatic image segmentation algorithm was designed based 
 on U‐Net to segment the collagen sponge layer of the scaffold from OCT images.
