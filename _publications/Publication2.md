title: "Optical coherence tomography for *in vivo* longitudinal monitoring of artificial dermal scaffold"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/Publication2
excerpt: '**Objectives**. Artificial dermal scaffold (ADS) has undergone rapid development and been increasingly used for treating skin wound in clinics due to its good biocompatibility, controllable degradation, and low risk of disease infection. To obtain a good treatment efficacy, ADS needs to be monitored longitudinally during the treatment process. For example, scaffold-tissue fit, cell in-growth, vascular regeneration and scaffold degradation are the key properties to be inspected. However, to date, there are no effective, real-time and noninvasive techniques to meet the requirement of the scaffold monitoring above.  
**Materials and Methods**. In this study, we propose to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to monitor ADS in vivo through three-dimensional imaging. A swept source OCT system with a handheld probe was developed for in vivo skin imaging. Moreover, a cell in-growth, vascular regeneration and scaffold degradation rate (IRDR) was defined with the volume reduction rate of the scaffold’s collagen sponge layer. To measure the IRDR, a semi-automatic image segmentation algorithm was designed based on U-Net to segment the collagen sponge layer of the scaffold from OCT images.  
**Results**. The results show that the scaffold-tissue fit can be clearly visualized under OCT imaging. The IRDR can be computed based on the volume of the segmented collagen sponge layer. It is observed that the IRDR appeared to a linear function of the time and in addition the IRDR varied among different skin parts. 
Conclusion. Overall, it can be concluded that OCT has a good potential to monitor ADS in vivo. This can help guide the clinicians to control the treatment with ADS to improve the therapy.'

**Abstract**  
**Objectives**. Artificial dermal scaffold (ADS) has undergone rapid development and been increasingly used for treating skin wound in clinics due to its good biocompatibility, controllable degradation, and low risk of disease infection. To obtain a good treatment efficacy, ADS needs to be monitored longitudinally during the treatment process. For example, scaffold-tissue fit, cell in-growth, vascular regeneration and scaffold degradation are the key properties to be inspected. However, to date, there are no effective, real-time and noninvasive techniques to meet the requirement of the scaffold monitoring above.  
**Materials and Methods**. In this study, we propose to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to monitor ADS in vivo through three-dimensional imaging. A swept source OCT system with a handheld probe was developed for in vivo skin imaging. Moreover, a cell in-growth, vascular regeneration and scaffold degradation rate (IRDR) was defined with the volume reduction rate of the scaffold’s collagen sponge layer. To measure the IRDR, a semi-automatic image segmentation algorithm was designed based on U-Net to segment the collagen sponge layer of the scaffold from OCT images.  
**Results**. The results show that the scaffold-tissue fit can be clearly visualized under OCT imaging. The IRDR can be computed based on the volume of the segmented collagen sponge layer. It is observed that the IRDR appeared to a linear function of the time and in addition the IRDR varied among different skin parts. 
Conclusion. Overall, it can be concluded that OCT has a good potential to monitor ADS in vivo. This can help guide the clinicians to control the treatment with ADS to improve the therapy.
